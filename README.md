# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
In this project, we aimed to design a webpage that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at once to provide precise and detailed analysis of UFO sightings.To achieve this, the handle click function was replaced with a new function that record the element, value, and id of the filter that is being changed. after completing the filters and once enter was pressed, the search criteria was looped through and only the results matching the criteria were kept in the new function.
