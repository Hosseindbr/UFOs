# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
In this project, we aimed to design a webpage that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at once to provide precise and detailed analysis of UFO sightings.To achieve this, the handle click function was replaced with a new function that record the element, value, and id of the filter that is being changed. after completing the filters and once enter was pressed, the search criteria was looped through and only the results matching the criteria were kept in the new function.
## Resources

## Summary
### Drawbacks
1. Date-specific format of search instead of date-range format; in the cirrent version the user must be aware of the exact date of UFO sighting to obtain the data.
2. The sensitivity of the filter to the uppercase and lowercase of the entered data. additionally, if the user include a space at the end of entered data there will be no data shown on the table.

### Recommendation
Recommendation
1.	Including a filter on a date range.
2.	Insensitivity of filters to the uppercase or lowercase and catching space at the end or beginning of the entered data.
